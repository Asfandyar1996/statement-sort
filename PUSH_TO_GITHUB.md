# Push to GitHub - Quick Steps

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository (30 seconds)

1. **Go to:** https://github.com/new
2. **Repository name:** `statement-sort`
3. **Visibility:** Private (or Public - your choice)
4. **DO NOT** check "Initialize with README"
5. **Click "Create repository"**

## Step 2: Copy the Repository URL

After creating, GitHub will show you a URL like:
`https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/statement-sort.git`

**Copy this URL** - you'll need it in the next step.

## Step 3: Push Your Code

Once you have the URL, tell me and I'll push the code for you!

Or run these commands in your terminal:
```bash
cd /Users/asfandyar.qadri/Documents/statement-sort
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/statement-sort.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username.

**After pushing, we'll connect it to Render!**
