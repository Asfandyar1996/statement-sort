# Create GitHub Repository - Step by Step

## Quick Steps

### Step 1: Create the Repository
1. **Open:** https://github.com/new
2. **Repository name:** `statement-sort`
3. **Description:** (optional) "Bank statement expense analyzer"
4. **Visibility:** 
   - ✅ **Private** (recommended - keeps your code private)
   - Or Public (if you want it public)
5. **IMPORTANT:** 
   - ❌ **DO NOT** check "Add a README file"
   - ❌ **DO NOT** check "Add .gitignore"
   - ❌ **DO NOT** check "Choose a license"
6. **Click "Create repository"**

### Step 2: After Creating
GitHub will show you a page with setup instructions. **Don't follow those** - we already have the code ready!

Just **copy the repository URL** - it will be:
`https://github.com/Asfandyar1996/statement-sort.git`

### Step 3: Tell Me When Done
Once you've created the repo, let me know and I'll push the code!

Or if you want to push it yourself, after creating the repo, run:
```bash
cd /Users/asfandyar.qadri/Documents/statement-sort
git push -u origin main
```

## What Happens Next

After the repo is created and code is pushed:
1. ✅ Code will be on GitHub
2. ✅ You can connect it to Render
3. ✅ Render will deploy your app
4. ✅ Your app will be live!

**Go create the repo now:** https://github.com/new
